# Meeting Document Extractor, Summarizer, and Email Generator

## Overview

This script efficiently processes and summarizes the content of various file types within a specified Google Drive folder. It supports both PDFs and certain audio file formats (e.g., MP3, MP4, MPEG). Summaries and follow-up emails are generated based on the extracted content using the GPT-4 model. 

## üåü Features

- Extract content from PDFs and audio files within a Google Drive folder.
- Generate a concise 2-page summary divided into:
  - General Discussion
  - Action Items
- Draft a follow-up email based on the meeting's content.
- Create Google Docs for both the summary and the email, which are then placed in the original folder.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. Google Apps Script permissions to access Google Drive, DocumentApp, and UrlFetchApp services.
2. Correct setup of the `GPT_API_URL` and `GPT_API_KEY` constants for your GPT-4 API endpoint and key.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Replace `specificFolderId` in the `runExtractionAndDocumentGeneration` function with your desired Google Drive folder's ID.
2. Execute the `runExtractionAndDocumentGeneration()` function.
3. Summaries and emails will be generated and stored as separate Google Docs within the original folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Always monitor the cost implications and potential rate limits associated with frequent GPT-4 API requests.
- Ensure the API key remains confidential to prevent unauthorized access.
